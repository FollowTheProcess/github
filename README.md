# GitHub

## What?

Centralised config for all my GitHub repos üõ†Ô∏è

## Why?

I'm bored of copy pasting everything around every time I change things, even [copier] templates need changes cascading manually.

## How?

* Files common to various GitHub repos are stored here
* When a release is made, the [Repo File Sync] action is triggered
* PR's are raised in the target repos with the changes
