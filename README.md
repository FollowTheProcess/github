# GitHub

## What?

Centralised config for all my GitHub repos.

## Why?

I'm bored of copy pasting everything around every time I change things, even [copier] templates need changes cascading manually.

## How?

Files are stored in certain places in here, then when they are changed a GitHub action creates a PR changing the files in the target repos.
